    "morphology is the study of structure and formation of words through combination of morphemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphemes are the smallest meaningful units in a language, and they can be base words, affixes and ending. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Base word: a word that can stand on its own and does not require any affixes to convey meaning.  Base words can be roots or stem. adding affixes to Base words can create new words. e.g., \"play\" + \"ing\" = \"playing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Stem: root or combination of a root with affixes. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        e.g., \"run\" in word \"running\"; \"unhappy\" in word \"unhappiness\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Root: A root is the most basic form of a word that carries the primary meaning. It cannot be further broken down into smaller units. e.g., \"cat,\", \"run\" and \"happy\" are root morphemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Affixes: can be attached to a root/stem/base word to change its meaning or function. There are several types of affixes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Prefixes: Added to the beginning of a word (e.g., \"un\" in \"unhappy\", \"re-\" in \"redo,\" and \"pre-\" in \"preheat.\").\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Infixes: Inserted within a word. rare in English, more common in other languages. (e.g., lots of 'o' in 'goooood' to emphasize good)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Suffixes: Added to the end of a word (e.g., \"ing\" in \"running\", \"-ed\" in \"played,\" and \"-ness\" in \"happiness.\").\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Circumfixes: Added to both the beginning and end of a word. It consists of a combination of a prefix and a suffix. (e.g., \"en\" and \"ed\" in \"enclosed\").\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Null morpheme: A morpheme that doesn't have a phonetic realization but still carries meaning. e.g., plural form of \"sheep\" remains \"sheep\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ending: An inflectional morpheme added to the end of a word to indicate its grammatical function, such as tense, number, case, or gender. For example, in the word \"agrees,\" the \"-s\" ending indicates the third person singular form of the verb.\n"

    "- French: more inflectional forms than English, especially for verbs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    verb inflects for tense, mood, and person (e.g., parle, parlons, parlais, parlerai).  40+ forms. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Nouns and adjectives inflect for *gender* and number (e.g., chat, chatte, chats, chattes).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Russian: nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and numerals inflect for six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, and prepositional. \n",
    "\n",
    "    These cases indicate the grammatical role of the word in a sentence (e.g., subject, object, or indirect object). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Verbs also inflect for tense, aspect, mood, and person.\n",
