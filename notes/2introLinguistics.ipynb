    "Speaker\n",
    "- Intention: The goals, shared knowledge, and beliefs of the speaker guide the formation of a message to be conveyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generation (Tactical): The process of constructing a message (sentence or utterance) based on the speaker's intention.\n",

    "- Perception: The listener receives the message, processing the text or speech signals.\n",

    "    - Syntactic 句法: Analyzing the structure and grammar of the message.\n",

    "    - Semantic 语义: Determining the meaning of the message.\n",

    "- Context: Both the speaker and listener rely on the context in which the communication takes place. Context provides a shared understanding and helps to disambiguate and clarify the intended meaning."

    "\n",
    "    - if a language has declarative sentences with nominal subject and object, the typical word order will be subject-object (e.g., \"John ate the apple\").\n",
    "\n",
    "    - if a language uses inflection to change the form of words (e.g., adding -s to make a noun plural in English), it will also have a system of derivation that allows the creation of new words by adding affixes or altering the base form of a word (e.g., adding -ness to create the noun \"happiness\" from the adjective \"happy\").\n"
