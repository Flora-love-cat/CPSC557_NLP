13:16:49	 From Manuel Martinez : could you explain the difference between stemming and lemmatization?
13:17:23	 From aditya chander, he/him (TA) : stemming is removing characters to reach a common substring, but lemmatisation is actually changing the word to some base form
13:17:47	 From aditya chander, he/him (TA) : eg. computer/computation’s stem would be comput, but the lemma is compute
13:18:06	 From Ayla Karakaş : was going to ask about that, thank you!!!
13:18:09	 From Manuel Martinez : I see thanks
13:18:35	 From Ayla Karakaş : also, are there situations in NLP where we might not want to normalize text?
13:19:16	 From aditya chander, he/him (TA) : possibly – for instance you might have “nineteenth century” (a noun phrase) vs. “nineteenth-century” (an adjective) and that difference may be meaningful
13:20:41	 From Manuel Martinez : is comput a word?
13:20:52	 From Manuel Martinez : does the stem have to be a word in the language's dictionary?
13:21:34	 From aditya chander, he/him (TA) : it’s not a meaningful word and it doesn’t have to be! but a lemma would have to be meaningful
13:21:51	 From Manuel Martinez : gotcha - thanks again :)
13:23:08	 From Ayla Karakaş : is there a way to handle sentences like comments/tweets that are run-on and lacking any sort of indication like punctuation/capitalization/etc?
13:24:57	 From Ayla Karakaş : thank you!
13:31:19	 From Alexander Lew : aspirated?
13:38:28	 From Manuel Martinez : what constitutes a language?
13:40:55	 From Nick Schoelkopf : ^ mutual intelligibility, I believe? Though there isn't exactly an objective measure
13:42:55	 From aditya chander, he/him (TA) : there’s a similar situation with hindi + urdu
14:03:44	 From Aaron Wade : Interlingua is another conlang that’s more based on Latin I believe
14:12:00	 From Aaron Wade : Expletive infixation
14:15:48	 From Sappho Gilbert : Edu-freakin'-cation
14:17:11	 From Adam Callister : Edu-ma-cation
14:17:58	 From Manuel Martinez : pretty much covered it all from Klingon to samoan :)
14:18:22	 From Sappho Gilbert : For my PhD, I work with communities in the Canadian Arctic that speak Inuktitut.
14:18:44	 From Ayla Karakaş : that's super cool :)
14:19:19	 From Sappho Gilbert : (I know a handful of words... it's VERY challenging to learn it, but I will continue to strive to!)
